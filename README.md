### Inspiration
Our inspiration was as students we get a ton of emails. However, while we are technically savvy, a lot of us are too often busy to bother fidgeting around in the settings.

### What it does
Our app has premade filters that automatically connect and sync to your Gmail account. They will apply filtering to future emails that you receive. Hopefully, drastically limiting the amount of nonimportant emails you receive.

### How we built it
We originally planned on having a Flask and React app. However, after much struggle we pivoted to a strictly Python application.

### Challenges we ran into
We ran into a lot of integration challenges. React and JavaScript did not incorporate well with Google OAuth.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
A GUI in Python (very hard to create). Our group coming together after being in the dumps and having no progress. We rallied and have a functional product by the end of the night.

### What we learned
We hate JS. But also never build GUIs in Python.

### What's next for EZ Filter
Building up our filter database with more useful and complex filters
Crowdsourcing email filtering from users, allowing people to submit ideas / contribute to existing general purpose filters
ability to remove filters that EzFilter has previously loaded into your Gmail account
